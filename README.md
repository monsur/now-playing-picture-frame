now-playing-picture-frame
=========================

This is a new version of the picture frame software I wrote at https://github.com/monsur/sonos-now-playing

Here are a few changes since that previous version:
  * Polls the Spotify API for music data (the previous version listened for Spotify events on the local network).
  * Displays photos from a Google Photos album when there isn't any music playing (the previous version just showed a blank screen).
  * Written in Kotlin (because I wanted to learn Kotlin).
